👋 Hi, I'm Alex and I really like Go.

I'm building a collection of composable libraries designed for constructing modern agentic applications. The idea is simple: small primitives with clear contracts that snap together without friction. Each library does one thing well and stays out of your way.

Some of these libraries are experimental but there is a lot available now that I hope you check out!
